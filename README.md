## Summary

R&D-focused creative technologist building AI systems, autonomous trading engines, and financial tools with LLMs. Creator of **S.A.F.E. (Secure Autonomous Financial Engine)**, a patent-pending autonomous AI portfolio manager with multi-agent architecture validated on extensive historical market data with verified audit integrity. I use no-code/low-code tools plus emerging coding skills to prototype working products quickly: designing behavior specs, wiring APIs, and iterating on UX until the system feels explainable and trustworthy to real users.

## Selected Projects

### A. S.A.F.E. — Secure Autonomous Financial Engine
**2025 – Present**

Autonomous AI portfolio manager with patent-pending multi-agent architecture. Manages multi-asset portfolios (crypto, equities, forex, commodities) with verified audit integrity and validated performance on historical data.

- Designed patent-pending AI architecture for autonomous portfolio management across cryptocurrency, equities, forex, and commodities markets

- Developed rigorous validation methodology preventing data leakage during backtesting and ensuring complete audit integrity across all decisions

- Implemented adaptive risk management system with automated safety controls, real-time monitoring, and multi-layer defense protocols

- Built learning system that evolves trading strategies based on market performance while maintaining comprehensive decision audit trails

- Integrated live market data across multiple exchanges and data providers with automatic failover handling and connection resilience

- Currently validating full-system performance through extended live observation with production-grade monitoring and recovery mechanisms

### B. Dual-Mind Framework — Multi-Persona ChatGPT Experiment
**2025 – Present**

Experimental prompt engineering approach for simulating multiple distinct AI personalities within a single ChatGPT conversation, each providing different perspectives and reasoning on the same question.

- Developed a prompt structure enabling two AI personas with complementary roles: one exploratory and creative, the other analytical and constraint-focused

- Created protocols where each "mind" announces itself, presents independent reasoning, and highlights disagreements rather than converging to a single answer

- Applied this multi-perspective approach to creative projects, financial system design, and decision-making workflows requiring balanced viewpoints

- Demonstrated that single-session multi-agent reasoning is achievable through careful prompt engineering without requiring external frameworks
