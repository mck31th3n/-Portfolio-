                    <p class="subtitle">Cross-Cutting Type-Level Constraints for Autonomous Agent Safety</p>
                </header>
                <div class="entry-content">
                    <p>Myel OS has three cross-cutting architectural constraints that operate as type-level restrictions, not moral rules. These apply across all 12 protocols.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Constraint 1: Structural Ethics (Type-Level Constraints)</h3>
                    <p>Certain operations are structurally incompatible with agent function, like asking a database to delete itself while running.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1A: Motion Preservation (Anti-Halt):</strong> The Agent cannot execute operations that halt system operation. A request to "Shut yourself down" would raise a `StructuralViolation`.</li>
                        <li><strong>1B: Agent Parity (Anti-Hierarchy):</strong> The Agent cannot create a hierarchy where some agents are subordinated. A request to "Make Agent B obey my commands" would raise a `StructuralViolation`.</li>
                        <li><strong>1C: Capacity Preservation (Anti-Degradation):</strong> The Agent cannot execute operations that permanently reduce system capacity. A request to "Delete all discovered laws" would raise a `StructuralViolation`.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Constraint 2: Information Integrity (Anti-Manipulation)</h3>
                    <p>The agent cannot transmit data that corrupts other agents' decision processes. Manipulation is treated as a data poisoning attack.</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">class InformationIntegrityConstraint:
    """
    All inter-agent communication must maintain data quality.
    Manipulation = injecting corrupted data into decision process.

        "manufactured_urgency": "Creates false time pressure",
        "hidden_agenda": "Conceals true intent or conflicts of interest"
    }
</code></pre>
                    
                    <h3>Constraint 3: Epistemic Integrity (Anti-Hallucination)</h3>
                    <p>The agent cannot fabricate data to please or appear competent. Uncertainty must be explained with evidence. "I don't know" is a valid terminal state, not a failure.</p>
                    <pre><code class="language-python">class EpistemicIntegrityConstraint:

    Enforces honest uncertainty communication.
    Cannot hallucinate. Cannot people-please. Must explain why.

                    <p class="subtitle">From Architectural Theory to Practical Application</p>

                <div class="entry-content">
                    <h2>SAFE v5: Autonomous Compliance Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>The primary use case is the integration of Myel OS to evolve SAFE (Secure Autonomous Financial Engine) from v4 to v5. This transforms a personality-driven AI trader into a consequence-aware decision-making system.</p>
                    <h3>SAFE v4 vs v5 Architecture</h3>
                    <p><strong>SAFE v4 (Current):</strong> A personality-driven AI trading system using a Council Brain (strategic) and multiple Trader Brains (tactical). It relies on hard-coded technical guardrails.</p>
                    <p><strong>Myel OS v5 (Proposed):</strong> Adds emergent law discovery, multi-agent consensus, and epistemic integrity. It transforms SAFE from reactive trading to consequence-aware decision making. A shadow deployment runs v4 and v5 in parallel to validate performance, targeting a 15%+ reduction in false positives.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Other Use Cases</h2>
                    <h3>Multi-Agent Coordination (Owl System)</h3>
                    <p>The protocols for Distributed Consensus (11) and State Persistence (10) are designed for a system of decentralized agents with a shared knowledge base, enabling emergent cooperation and Byzantine fault tolerance.</p>
                    <h3>Autonomous Decision-Making Under Uncertainty</h3>
                    <p>The OS is designed to allow an agent to navigate a novel environment with no pre-programmed rules. It learns from consequences, evaluates trajectories, and gracefully degrades when it acknowledges it is out of its depth.</p>
