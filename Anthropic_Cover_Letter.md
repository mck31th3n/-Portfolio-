# Cover Letter: Cross-functional Prompt Engineer
**Anthropic | San Francisco, CA**

---

Dear Anthropic Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the Cross-functional Prompt Engineer role. Over the past year, I've built S.A.F.E. (Secure Autonomous Financial Engine)—a patent-pending autonomous AI portfolio manager with a dual-brain architecture that's made 66,000+ verified trading decisions across cryptocurrency, equities, forex, and commodities. This work has given me deep, practical experience in exactly what this role requires: designing complex multi-agent prompt systems, building evaluation frameworks, and obsessing over AI safety and alignment.

**Why I'm a strong fit:**

**Complex prompt engineering at scale:** S.A.F.E.'s dual-brain architecture uses a strategic oversight layer (powered by o3-deep-research) that provides regime analysis every 15 minutes, coordinating with five specialized tactical execution agents (gpt-5-mini) that make real-time trading decisions. I've authored and refined the system prompts that enable these agents to balance competing objectives—risk management, opportunity detection, and regime adaptation—across multiple asset classes simultaneously.

**Evaluation frameworks and behavioral testing:** I built a comprehensive validation system with temporal isolation protocols that ensure zero future data leakage during backtesting. Every decision is logged in cryptographically hash-chained audit trails (814+ model events verified). I've stress-tested the system across blind historical data (2020-2024), including the COVID crash, tracking performance metrics, confidence scores, and regime detection accuracy.

**Safety-first design:** S.A.F.E. includes automated circuit breakers with adaptive risk thresholds, hallucination detection, input validation systems, and multi-layer defense protocols. I've designed the system to fail safely—if something goes wrong, it locks down rather than executes questionable decisions. This safety-conscious approach aligns directly with Anthropic's constitutional AI principles.

**Claude experience:** I currently use Claude Sonnet in my development stack and have hands-on familiarity with its reasoning capabilities, limitations, and behavioral quirks. I've also experimented with multi-persona prompt engineering (my "Dual-Mind Framework"), where I designed prompts that simulate multiple distinct AI personalities providing complementary perspectives within a single conversation.

**Non-traditional background as a strength:** My MFA in Music Composition taught me pattern recognition, structural thinking, and how to balance technical precision with creative problem-solving—skills that translate directly to designing AI behaviors that feel coherent and trustworthy. I've spent the past year teaching myself Python, agent architecture, and LLM systems by building production-quality prototypes that demonstrate real-world capability rather than just theoretical knowledge.

**Open to other opportunities:** While the Cross-functional Prompt Engineer role aligns perfectly with my experience, I'm genuinely excited about Anthropic's mission and would welcome conversations about other roles where my background in multi-agent orchestration, evaluation frameworks, and AI safety architecture could add value.

I know this role likely expects candidates with traditional CS degrees and 5+ years at OpenAI or DeepMind. What I bring instead is a portfolio of working systems that demonstrate I can do the job: I've designed complex prompt architectures, built robust evaluation frameworks, and shipped code that makes autonomous decisions with verified audit integrity.

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how my hands-on experience building AI systems could contribute to shaping Claude's behaviors and advancing Anthropic's alignment research.

Thank you for your consideration.
