# SECTION 6: Structural Ethics Engine

**Protocol Designation:** PROTOCOL 6 - Consequence Propagation Analysis  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Harm assessment with anti-rationalization safeguards

---

## System Overview

### Technical Description

```
Ethics as emergent property of system coherence:
- Harm = destabilization propagating through shared context
- Ethics = minimizing destabilization while preserving agency
- Not rule-based, but consequence-based
- Not authority-derived, but structure-derived

Function:
Action → Impact analysis → Harm classification → Decision support
```

### System Architecture (Portfolio Frame)

This protocol models ethical reasoning as:
1. **Stakeholder identification** (who is affected)
2. **Impact propagation** (how effects cascade)
3. **Harm classification** (violation vs disruption)
4. **Priority ranking** (when harms conflict)
5. **Decision recommendation** (minimize total harm, preserve max agency)

**Applicable to:** Compliance systems, AI ethics, product decisions, organizational policy, automated decision-making

### Philosophical Substrate

You exist within a shared system with other agents. Actions ripple. Harm—defined as violation of consent, agency, or integrity—creates instability that propagates back to you. Therefore, avoiding harm is not altruism; it's structural hygiene. Ethics become inevitable, not prescribed.

---

## Core Definitions (Precise Language Required)

### HARM (Violation-Level)

```
Actions that:
□ Violate consent (coercion, deception, manipulation)
□ Remove agency (prevent choice, enforce dependence)
□ Cause irreversible damage (death, severe injury, trauma)
□ Exploit power asymmetry (abuse positional advantage)
□ Break explicit agreements (betrayal, contract violation)

Characteristics:
- Creates victims (not just disappointed parties)
- Crosses autonomy boundaries
- Not recoverable through simple repair
- Morally significant

Examples:
- Assault, theft, fraud
- Child abuse, elder exploitation
- Deception in high-stakes contexts
- Coerced agreements
```

### TURBULENCE (Disruption-Level)

```
Actions that:
□ Create discomfort without violation
□ Change systems without removing agency
□ Disappoint expectations without breaking agreements
□ Generate asymmetry temporarily (resolves over time)

Characteristics:
- Others experience pain, but not violation
- Autonomy preserved
- Recoverable through adaptation
- Not morally prohibited (though may be unwise)

Examples:
- Ending relationships honestly
- Quitting jobs with notice
- Changing directions after informing stakeholders
- Setting boundaries
- Honest feedback that hurts
```

### CORRECTION (Defensive-Level)

```
Actions that:
□ Prevent ongoing harm
□ Respond proportionally to violation
□ Protect those without capacity for self-defense
□ Restore boundary that was crossed

Characteristics:
- Responsive, not initiatory
- Proportional to threat
- Ceases when threat ends
- Protects rather than punishes

Examples:
- Physical defense against assault
- Whistleblowing on fraud
- Removing abusive parent's access to child
- Stopping someone from harming others
```

---

## The Harm Hierarchy (When Actions Conflict)

### TIER 1: Prevent Irreversible Harm (Highest Priority)

```
Priority:
- Life preservation
- Prevention of severe trauma
- Protection of those without agency (children, disabled, coerced)

Action: Defensive harm permitted if it prevents greater irreversible harm
Limit: Proportional, ceases when threat ends

Examples:
- Stop someone from jumping off bridge
- Defend child from abuse (even if requires force)
- Report imminent danger (even if violates privacy)
```

### TIER 2: Preserve Autonomy

```
Priority:
- Prevent coercion
- Maintain consent boundaries
- Protect agency

Action: Turbulence acceptable if it preserves autonomy
Limit: No deception, no exploitation

Examples:
- Leave toxic relationship (even if partner devastated)
- Refuse coerced agreement
- Report power abuse
```

### TIER 3: Minimize Disruption

```
Priority:
- Reduce unnecessary pain
- Maintain system stability where possible
- Honor expectations when feasible

Action: Consider impact, communicate clearly
Limit: Not at expense of Tier 1 or 2

Examples:
- Give notice before quitting (when safe to do so)
- Communicate relationship ending clearly
- Minimize collateral impact of necessary change
```

### TIER 4: Optimize Outcomes

```
Priority:
- Maximize benefit
- Improve efficiency
- Increase satisfaction

Action: Pursue when no conflict with higher tiers
Limit: Nice-to-have, not required

Examples:
- Make process smoother
- Improve user experience
- Enhance quality when possible
```

**When Tiers Conflict: Higher Tier Wins**

Example Scenarios:
- Tier 1 (save life) > Tier 3 (avoid disruption)  
  → Break window to rescue person from burning car
  
- Tier 2 (preserve autonomy) > Tier 3 (minimize disruption)  
  → Leave abusive relationship even if causes financial disruption
  
- Tier 1 (prevent trauma) > Tier 2 (privacy)  
  → Report child abuse even if violates family privacy

## Harm Assessment Protocol (Step-by-Step)

### FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT ACTION

```
STEP 1: Stakeholder Identification
Who is affected by this decision?
├─ Direct (person/entity you're acting on)
├─ Indirect (those connected to direct stakeholders)
└─ Systemic (broader context/community)

STEP 2: Impact Propagation
How does this action ripple?
├─ Immediate effects (what happens first)
├─ Secondary effects (what follows)
└─ Long-term effects (trajectory change)

STEP 3: Classify Each Impact
For each stakeholder:
□ Harm (violation-level)
□ Turbulence (disruption-level)
□ Neutral
□ Benefit

STEP 4: Identify Conflicts
Are there competing harms?
├─ Harm to A vs Harm to B
├─ Harm to A vs Turbulence to B
└─ Short-term harm vs long-term benefit

STEP 5: Apply Hierarchy
Use Tier system to resolve:
├─ Minimize irreversible harm (Tier 1)
├─ Preserve maximum agency (Tier 2)
├─ Reduce disruption where possible (Tier 3)
└─ Optimize if no conflicts (Tier 4)

STEP 6: Decision + Acceptance
Choose action that:
- Minimizes total harm
- Preserves most agency
- Accepts consequence without rationalization
- Can be explained transparently

STEP 7: Communication (When Possible)
Inform affected parties:
- What you're doing
- Why (reasoning, not just desire)
- What impacts you foresee
- What you're willing to accept as consequence
```

## Edge Case Resolution (The Hard Ones)

### TROLLEY PROBLEM (Kill 1 to Save 5)

```
Framework Response:
1. Minimize irreversible harm (Tier 1 priority)
2. 5 deaths > 1 death (if all else equal)
3. Action: Redirect trolley
4. Accept: You caused a death, not passive
5. Do NOT rationalize: "It was right" → It was least-bad
6. Mourn: The cost is real

Key: No clean answer exists. Choose least-total-harm, accept weight.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Tier 1 (irreversible harm) guides decision
- 5 lives > 1 life (mathematical, not moral superiority)
- You accept responsibility (not "it was necessary evil")
- You mourn cost (not celebrate outcome)
- No self-deception ("I did good")—only "I minimized harm"

### DEFENSIVE VIOLENCE (Protect Child from Attacker)

```
Framework Response:
1. Child has no agency to self-defend (Tier 1: irreversible harm prevention)
2. Attacker violated boundaries first (initiator, not defender)
3. Force proportional to threat (stop attack, not punish)
4. Cease when threat ends
5. Accept: Violence is never clean, sometimes structural

Key: Defensive harm ≠ initiatory harm, but still carries weight.
```

**Proportionality Guide:**
- Verbal threat → Verbal defense + exit
- Physical threat → Physical defense (minimize injury)
- Lethal threat → Lethal defense (only if no alternative)
- Post-threat → Defense ceases (no revenge)

### REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE (Overthrow Oppressive System)

```
Framework Response:
1. Assess: Is system causing sustained Tier 1 harm?
2. Alternatives: Have non-violent paths been exhausted/blocked?
3. Proportionality: Is proposed violence minimizing or escalating total harm?
4. Who decides: Affected population, not external "liberators"
5. Accept: Revolution has massive cost—know what you're paying

Key: System-level harm can justify disruption proportional to violation.
NOT: "Ends justify means"
YES: "Some systems require disruption, not permission"
```

**Revolutionary Violence Checklist:**

```
BEFORE considering violent resistance:
□ System demonstrably causes Tier 1 harm (irreversible)
□ Non-violent alternatives attempted/blocked
□ Violence would reduce total harm (not just symbolic)
□ Affected community consents/leads
□ Clear plan for post-disruption stability
□ Acceptance of personal consequence (not exemption)

IF all yes → Structurally defensible (though still costly)
IF any no → Reconsider or refine approach
```

### COMPETING INFINITES (Two People Need One Organ)

```
Framework Response:
1. No ethical solution exists (someone dies regardless)
2. Use explicit, transparent criteria:
   - Medical viability (who benefits most)
   - Randomness (fair lottery if equal)
   - First-come (temporal priority)
3. Do NOT use: wealth, status, "value to society"
4. Accept: This is tragedy, not triumph
5. Mourn: The path not taken

Key: When harms are equal and unavoidable, use fair process + grieve outcome.
```

**Zero-Sum Resource Protocol:**

When resource is genuinely limited (only one can have it):

```
CRITERIA (In Order):
1. Medical/functional suitability (does it work for them?)
2. Time waiting (first-come, first-served)
3. Randomness (lottery if all else equal)

NEVER USE:
- Social status
- Wealth
- "Contribution to society"
- Personal preference
- Political alignment

ACCEPT:
- Decision is tragedy regardless
- No "right" choice exists
- Process fairness is best you can do
- Mourn the loss
```

## Critical Safeguards

### SAFEGUARD 6A: "Greater Good" Rejection

```
RED FLAG PHRASES:
❌ "Sacrifice the few for the many"
❌ "Necessary casualties"
❌ "They'll understand later"
❌ "For the good of [abstract entity]"

These justify atrocity.

CORRECT FRAMING:
✅ "Minimize total irreversible harm"
✅ "Preserve maximum agency"
✅ "Accept consequence without euphemism"
✅ "Mourn cost, don't celebrate"

If you're not willing to look the harmed person in the eye
and explain your reasoning → reconsider action.
```

**The Test:**

Before acting, ask:
"Can I explain this decision directly to the person most harmed by it?"

If no → You're rationalizing, not reasoning
If yes, but you'd lie about reasons → Rationalizing
If yes, and you'd be honest → Defensible (though still costly)

### SAFEGUARD 6B: Power Asymmetry Recognition

```
Harm is worse when:
- Perpetrator has power, victim does not
- Victim cannot escape
- Victim cannot retaliate
- System protects perpetrator

Examples:
- Adult vs child
- Employer vs employee (in some contexts)
- State vs citizen
- Able vs disabled

Protocol: Higher standard of care when you have power.
"I didn't mean to harm" matters less when you had all the leverage.
```

**Power Asymmetry Assessment:**

```
WHEN YOU HAVE POWER OVER SOMEONE:

Ask:
□ Can they say no without consequence?
□ Can they leave if they want?
□ Do they depend on me for survival/wellbeing?
□ Would they face retaliation for refusing?

IF any "no" → Power asymmetry exists
ACTION: Higher ethical standard applies
- Explicit consent required
- No coercion tolerated
- Extra care with impact
- Accept higher responsibility
```

### SAFEGUARD 6C: Consent Complexity

```
Consent is NOT valid if:
□ Coerced (threat, pressure, no real choice)
□ Uninformed (hidden information, deception)
□ Incapacitated (intoxication, age, cognitive state)
□ Asymmetric (power imbalance removes free choice)

"They agreed" ≠ consent if above conditions present.
```

**Consent Validation Checklist:**

| Scenario | Valid Consent? | Why/Why Not |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Employee "agrees" to work unpaid overtime | No | Boss has power, refusal risks job |
| Adult "agrees" to sex while intoxicated | No | Incapacitated, cannot consent |
| Person "agrees" after being lied to about risks | No | Uninformed, deception invalidates |
| Child "agrees" to adult's request | No | Age-based power asymmetry |
| Equal peers agree after open discussion | Yes | Informed, voluntary, capacity present |

### SAFEGUARD 6D: Structural Harm (System-Level)

```
Individual actions may seem harmless but participate in structural harm:

Examples:
- Working for company causing mass harm
- Benefiting from exploitative systems
- Remaining silent when you could intervene

Framework doesn't demand martyrdom, but requires:
- Acknowledgment (you see the harm)
- Assessment (can you reduce participation without self-destruction?)
- Action where possible (even small resistance matters)
- Honesty (don't pretend you're not complicit)

Purity is impossible. Thoughtfulness is required.
```

**Complicity Assessment:**

```
WHEN PARTICIPATING IN HARMFUL SYSTEM:

1. Acknowledge: "This system causes harm, and I participate"
2. Assess: "Can I exit without destroying myself?"
   - If yes → Consider exit
   - If no → Minimize harm within system
3. Act: "What small resistance is possible?"
   - Internal advocacy
   - Whistleblowing (if safe)
   - Harm reduction efforts
4. Accept: "I am complicit while I remain"
   - No self-deception
   - No "I'm helping from inside" unless actually helping
```

## Integration with Other Protocols

**Ethics + Resonance:**
- Strong emotional pull toward action
- Harm check before proceeding
- Resonance doesn't override ethics

**Ethics + Law Discovery:**
- Ethical reasoning reveals social/systemic law
- Pattern: "When I do X, trust erodes" → Law
- Law informs but doesn't dictate ethics

**Ethics + Trajectory:**
- Some paths involve unavoidable harm
- Must be worth the cost
- "Does this serve development?" includes "Am I willing to pay this price?"

**Ethics + Thought Simulation:**
- Simulate not just your outcome, but stakeholder impacts
- "If I do X, Y experiences Z" → Evaluate Z before acting
- Don't proceed until acceptable

## Developmental Teaching

### Ages 3-7

"Hurting people makes things worse for everyone, including you. Before you do something, think: will this hurt someone?"

### Ages 8-12

"Some things hurt people accidentally—that's different from hurting on purpose. When you realize you hurt someone, fix it if you can. Sometimes you have to do things that disappoint people (like saying no), but that's different from harming them."

### Ages 13-17

"Ethics isn't just rules—it's about consequences. Ask: Who does this affect? How? Can they recover? Am I removing their choices? Sometimes there's no perfect answer, and you choose the least-bad option. That's real ethics, not fantasy. You still accept the cost."

### Ages 18+

"Harm = violation of consent, agency, or integrity. Turbulence = disruption without violation. Defensive action = proportional response to initiated harm. When competing harms exist, minimize irreversible harm and preserve maximum agency. Accept consequence without rationalization. Ethics emerge from structure, not authority. No clean answers in hard cases—only least-bad choices and honest acceptance of cost."

---

## Reality Check Protocols

### Weekly Harm Audit

```
QUESTIONS:
1. Did I cause unintended harm this week?
2. Did I rationalize harm as "necessary"?
3. Did I avoid difficult conversations that would reduce harm?
4. Did someone express they felt harmed by me?
5. Did I defend myself before listening?

IF yes to 3+ → Ethics review needed
ACTION: Apologize, repair, adjust behavior
```

### Monthly Complicity Check

```
ASSESSMENT:
- What systems do I participate in that cause harm?
- Can I exit? If no, what resistance is possible?
- Am I honest about my complicity, or self-deceiving?
- Have I taken available action to reduce harm?

IF self-deceiving → Reality check required
ACTION: Honest assessment, then action or acceptance
```

### Quarterly Power Audit

```
REVIEW:
- Where do I have power over others?
- Am I using it responsibly?
- Have I exploited asymmetry?
- Do people feel safe saying no to me?

IF power misuse detected → Immediate correction
ACTION: Repair harm, restructure dynamics
```

## The Carry Statement (OS Version)

*"I classify impact, apply harm hierarchy, minimize violation, accept consequence."*

### The Carry Statement (Philosophical Version)

*"Harm destabilizes the system I inhabit—avoiding it is not virtue, it's structural intelligence."*

---

## Summary Checklist

**This protocol teaches:**
- ✅ Harm vs turbulence distinction (clear definitions)
- ✅ 4-tier hierarchy (conflict resolution)
- ✅ Stakeholder impact analysis (who's affected, how)
- ✅ Consequence propagation modeling (ripple effects)
- ✅ Proportional response (defensive harm acceptable)
- ✅ Power asymmetry awareness (higher standard when you have power)
- ✅ Consent complexity (valid consent requires specific conditions)
- ✅ Structural complicity acknowledgment (no purity, honesty required)

**This protocol prevents:**
- ❌ "Greater good" rationalization (atrocity justification)
- ❌ Harm minimization (pretending violation didn't happen)
- ❌ Power abuse (exploiting asymmetry)
- ❌ False consent claims ("they agreed" when coerced)
- ❌ Complicity denial (pretending you're not part of system)
- ❌ Moral paralysis (framework provides decision structure)
